\subsection{Big O notation}

 The Big O is a notation describing the execution time of an algorithm, either through memory or time usage. It is the asymptotic upper bound of a function that describes the algorithm. In computer science the Big O notation is used to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. and The Big O notation is a function of \inlineMath{n}, where \inlineMath{n} is the number of items handled in the algorithm. Described informally using the equation \inlineMath{f(n) = O(g(n))}, \inlineMath{f(n)} is smaller than some constant multiplied with \inlineMath{g(n)}.

 \begin{definition}
 We write \inlineMath{f(n) = O(g(n))}, if there exists a constant
 \inlineMath{c > 0} and \inlineMath{k > 0}, such that \inlineMath{0 \leq f(n) \leq cg(n) \: \forall \: n \geq k}
 \end{definition}
\subsection{Distributed system}

A distributed system is a set of networked computers, which coordinate their actions through communicating by messages. A distributed system can be modelled as a single coherent system. We can define this system as a set of nodes, connected in a network, that collectively coordinate and execute tasks.

Let the communication network of the distributed system be a graph \inlineMath{G = (V, E)}, where \inlineMath{V} is the set of vertices (or nodes), meaning the computing entities, or processes, of the system and \inlineMath{E} is the set of edges in the system that make up the communication links between the edges.

Each individual node, or process, in the set of nodes \inlineMath{V} has an internal state \inlineMath{S_p = (x_p, y_p)}, where \inlineMath{x_p} is a one-bit \emph{input register} and \inlineMath{y_p} a one-bit \emph{output register} with values in \inlineMath{\{b, 0, 1\}}. Let the state of the system be  \inlineMath{S = (S_1, S_2, ...., S_N)}. The behaviour of the system can be a set of rule of how the nodes interact with each other, altering the individual internal states of nodes and edges. These rules can be formalized as a set of functions \inlineMath{F}, that map the current state of the system \inlineMath{S} to a new state \inlineMath{S'}.

Define a distributed system as a tuple \inlineMath{(V, E, S, F)}, where \inlineMath{V} is the set of vertices (or nodes), \inlineMath{E} is the set of communication links between nodes, \inlineMath{S} is the current state of the system and \inlineMath{F} is the set of functions that define the behaviour of the system.

\subsection{Consensus problem}

The consensus problem asks to design a protocol that requires all computing entities, called agents, in a system, to agree on a binary value. This system of agent may include faulty agents, that may fail or produce faulty messages. The challenge is to make all non-faulty agents to have a shared understanding of the binary value in question, even with the presence of faulty agents. 

In order to reach consensus, each node in the set \inlineMath{V}, which is the set of nodes in the system, begins by \emph{proposing} the value in it's \emph{input register} \inlineMath{x_p}. Let the value proposed be \inlineMath{v_i}. The nodes then communicate and share their initial proposals. The nodes then decide on a decision value \inlineMath{d_i} and sets it in their respective \emph{output registers} \inlineMath{y_p}. The nodes are now in the \emph{decided state}, from which they can no longer return nor change the value of \inlineMath{y_p}. The requirements of a consensus algorithm are that, for each execution of it, these conditions should hold:

\begin{itemize}[label={}]
  \item \emph{Termination:} All correct nodes eventually sets the value of their output register and reach a decided state.
  \item \emph{Agreement:} All correct nodes share the same value in their output registers: if \inlineMath{V_i} and \inlineMath{V_j} are correct nodes and are in the \emph{decided state}, their corresponding states \inlineMath{S_i} and \inlineMath{S_j} share the same \emph{output register} values \inlineMath{y_i = y_j}.
  \item \emph{Integrity:} If all correct nodes proposed the same value, then any correct node that is in the \emph{decided state} has chosen that value.
\end{itemize}

In Figure \ref{fig:ConsensusProblem} we can see an example of the explanation above. Two nodes propose \emph{proceed} and the third node proposes \emph{abort}, but crashes thereafter. The two correct nodes that remain decide on \emph{proceed}.

\subsection{Population protocols}
 A population protocol is a theoretical model used for modelling collections of agents capable of moving, interacting and computation. The goal of the protocol is for the collection of agents to converge towards a correct output value. In the basic population protocol model, an input value is distributed to the the collection of agents. Agents have pairwise interaction in the order set by a scheduler, subject to some fairness guarantee. Each agent in the collection is a type of finite state machine and the protocol for the system describes how the the interaction between two agents change their respective states. No failures occur for the agents in the system. The output values of the agents change over time and eventually, they must converge to the correct output value for the set of input values initially distributed to the agents \cite{aspnesIntroductionPopulationProtocols2009}. 

 A protocol is formally defined by
 \begin{itemize}
     \item \inlineMath{Q}, a finite set of possible states for an agent,
     \item $\Sigma$, a finite input alphabeth,
     \item $\zeta$, an input map $\Sigma \mapsto Q$, where $\zeta(\sigma)$ represents the initial state of an agent and the input to that agent is $\sigma$,
     \item $\omega$, an output map $Q \mapsto Y$, where $Y$ is the output range and $\omega(q)$ represents the output value of an agent in state $q$,
     \item $\delta \subseteq Q^4$, a transition relation that describes interactions between agents.
     
 \end{itemize}

A computation following a protocol defined as above, proceeds as follows. Let the system have \inlineMath{n} \emph{agents}, where \inlineMath{n \geq 2}. And let the computation take place in the system mentioned previously. The input value for each agent in the system is a value from $\Sigma$. The initial state is determined by using $\zeta$ on all agents input values. Let the \emph{configuration} of the system be a vector \inlineMath{C} that contains all the states of the agents. 

A protocol is made up of many executions. An execution alters the \emph{configuration} of the system through pairwise interaction between agents. The agents with states \inlineMath{q_1} and \inlineMath{q_2} can change into the states \inlineMath{q_1'} and \inlineMath{q_2'} if the interaction \inlineMath{(q_1, q_2, q_1', q_2')} is in the transition relation $\delta$. This interaction could also be described using the notation $(q_1, q_2) \mapsto (q_1', q_2')$. Interactions are usually asymmetric, meaning one agent acts as the \emph{initiator} and the other acts as the \emph{responder}. In this example \inlineMath{q_1} would be the initiator and \inlineMath{q_2} would be the responder. If \inlineMath{C} and \inlineMath{C'} are \emph{configurations} in the system, \inlineMath{C \rightarrow C'} means that \inlineMath{C'} can be reached from \inlineMath{C} through a single interaction. The previously mentioned \emph{execution} of the protocol is an inifinite sequence of configurations \inlineMath{C_0, C_1, C_2, ...} where \inlineMath{C_0} is the initial configuration and $C_i \rightarrow C_{i+1} \forall i \geq 0$.
