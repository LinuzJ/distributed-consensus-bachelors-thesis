\subsection{Background}
\linus{TODO: Explain background to consensus problem and its relation to population protocols}

The consensus problem is fundamental challenge in the field of distributed computing. The problem has been studied extensively in literature and there are multiple popular algorithms 


\subsection{Simple Population Protocol}
\linus{TODO: Go through results of Angluin Simple Population Protocol \cite{angluinSimplePopulationProtocol2008}}

\subsection{Generalization}
\linus{Go through the results of the recent study \cite{AspnesFastConverganceOfKOpinion2023} that generalizes the results of \cite{angluinSimplePopulationProtocol2008} }
